This is a react component built using TypeScript for diffing and merging JSON documents.

To install the required dependencies, run `npm install`.

To build the project, run `npm run magic`. This will transpile the TypeScript source into a CommonJS bundle in the `build` directory.

You can test the project locally by opening the file `public/index.html` in your web browser.
